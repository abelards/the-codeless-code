Illus.0.title: It probably fell from a red-black tree.

The development teams managed by abbot [[Ruh Cheen]] of the
[[Spider Clan]] were quite pleased with the abbot's decision
to [[#210|eliminate all design documents]].  For less time
writing meant more time coding, which was their principal
joy.  And since the Temple built its teams with
developers from all three major clans, word soon
spread throughout the
[[Elephant's Footprint Clan|Elephant's Footprint]] and
[[Laughing Monkey Clan|Laughing Monkey]],
whose monks petitioned their own abbots to follow
Ruh Cheen's example.

As the flow of documentation slowed to a trickle,
one voice that remained oddly silent was that
of the old scribe [[Qi]], who was responsible for
cataloging all Temple knowledge -- chiefly, the designs
of its many systems.  A junior monk asked the scribe, "Why
have you raised no objections to this new practice?  It
seems destined to make you obsolete."

The scribe replied, "I do not rebuke the sun for rising late
in autumn."

The monk reported to his fellows that the scribe had simply
surrendered to the inevitable.  Yet one senior monk was
suspicious.

"Tell me his words exactly," said the senior monk.

When the junior monk did this, the senior monk laughed and
went to see the scribe.

"So," the senior monk said to Qi, "our scribe welcomes the
shorter days.  Is it because he is fond of golden leaves and
crisp apples?  Or has he simply tired of warm afternoons?"

"Let he who dreams of endless summer spend a year in the
desert," replied the scribe.

"And let he who fancies autumn spend a day among the birds
and beasts," said the senior monk, "for they know that
colder days are coming.  What is your plan for the winter of
your days, when your services are no longer required?
Emigrate?  Hibernate?"

"Innovate," said the scribe.  "And if I can invent nothing,
I shall reinvent myself.  Let mathematicians talk of
/pi/ and /e/ and /i/ and /phi/.  The only constant of
consequence is /delta-t/, the Inconstant Constant, whose
value no one knows, except that it always exceeds zero."

"Yet if you remain here, you must witness the death of all
you have created," observed the senior monk.

The old scribe removed his spectacles to polish them.  "When
the last leaf has fallen, ask [[#181|Shinpuru the gardener]]
why he does not burn his rake for warmth."
